Domain Adaptation for Structural Health Monitoring

In this repo, you can find the DANN application for gearbox fault detection classification (Case 1) and damage classification for a 3DOF structure (Case 2). To my best knowledge, this is the only proper DANN code for Keras/TF2.0.

flipGradientTF.py/flipGradientKeras.py from @bearnshaw is slightly modifed for the gradient reversal layer to work.
